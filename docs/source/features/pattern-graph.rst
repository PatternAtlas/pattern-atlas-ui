The Pattern Graph displays all the Patterns of a Pattern Language or a :doc:`Pattern View<pattern-views>`

The Pattern Graph supports the following operations:

* Relations can be added by hovering the source pattern and dragging the grey circle onto the target pattern.
* Relations can be deleted by clicking the grey circle on a relation.
* The Layout of the graph can be edited by moving the Patterns via Drag & Drop or by clicking "Reformat"
* Selecting a Pattern shows the Patterns relations
* Clicking the Info-Button navigates to the Detail View of a Pattern where the content of the Pattern can be seen.
