Pattern Views
=============

Pattern Views enable cross Pattern Language relations. A Pattern View can contain subsets of Patterns from multiple Pattern Languages.
A Pattern View has its own :doc:`pattern-graph` and :doc:`Pattern Relation<pattern-relations>`.
A detailed introduction to Pattern Views can be found here_.

To create a Pattern View select the "Pattern Views" tab and click "Add View".

To add Patterns to the view click on "Add Patterns" and select the needed Patterns from the different languages. It is possible to import all Patterns of one language or just single Patterns.
