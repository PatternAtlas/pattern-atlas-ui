                        "Reusability: It might be possible to reuse existing hardware as a DEVICE GATEWAY, for example, smartphones or routers, which might further decrease the effort and cost needed."^^xsd:string ,
                        "Separation of Concerns: Device implementations can focus on only one arbitrary protocol or technology, which makes them simpler. On the other hand, the DEVICE GATEWAY can be optimized for protocol translation."^^xsd:string ,
                        "Technological Limitations: Devices can use very limited communication technology in the form of a specifically reduced software stack. So they can exploit their limited power elsewhere, while still being able to connect to a network that requires more sophisticated technology through a DEVICE GATEWAY."^^xsd:string ;
               <https://purl.org/patternpedia/internetofthingspatterns#context> "A number of devices have to be connected to a network. These might include Constrained Devices or Semi-Constrained Devices that are limited in their processing power and do not support the communication methods of the network. Or these might also include Unconstrained Devices from legacy systems that cannot connect to the network due to outdated technology. A backend server reachable over this network is intended to process data from these devices."^^xsd:string ;

A DEVICE GATEWAY might only be able to create a partial translation between these technologies, or it might not be able to translate between certain technologies at all."^^xsd:string ,
                         "Complexity: Another layer of components is introduced that has to be managed and maintained. This becomes even more difficult if multiple kinds of gateways are used."^^xsd:string ,
                         "Connectivity: The DEVICE GATEWAY might become a single point of failure for the network connectivity of the connected devices. Adding redundant DEVICE GATEWAYS with a failover mechanism could alleviate this problem, but at an increased cost."^^xsd:string ,
                         "Cost: The DEVICE GATEWAY usually has to support multiple communication technologies and, thus, needs more processing power, which makes it expensive. In addition, if devices are distributed, possibly multiple DEVICE GATEWAYS are required to connect all of them. Costs might be reduced by using a modular DEVICE GATEWAY design, where only the required technologies can be added with extension boards."^^xsd:string ,
                         "Security: As a single point of attack the DEVICE GATEWAY also poses a security risk. If compromised, an attacker could gain access to all attached devices or the backend server."^^xsd:string ;
               <https://purl.org/patternpedia/internetofthingspatterns#examples> "Central hubs are a common occurrence in the product portfolios of home automation companies. Here they often act as an indispensable central point for integrating and managing the actual home automation devices. Examples are the Samsung SmartThings Hub [SmartThings 2015] which supports ZigBee, Z-Wave, and IP, or the Wink Hub [Wink 2015] that additionally supports Bluetooth Low Energy and Lutron Clear Connect7. The SmartThings Hub v2 also introduced local processing capabilities, which is also supported by other DEVICE GATEWAYS like the THNGHUB [EVRYTHNG 2016]. Various companies offer development kits and appliances to implement DEVICE GATEWAYS for industrial use, such as Intel, Dell, or Nexcom [Dell 2016; Intel 2016; Nexcom 2016]. The Eclipse Kura project is an Open Source framework for building the software side of DEVICE GATEWAYS [Eclipse Foundation 2016]. Zachariah et al. [2015] proposed to use smartphones with Bluetooth Low Energy as universal gateways for other devices. In a way, smartphones are already used as DEVICE GATEWAYS for many wearable devices, like fitness trackers or smartwatches, which completely rely on the smartphone to communicate the data they collected to the backend. Many IoT platform documentations mention physical hubs or field gateways as a way to connect devices to their platforms that cannot connect to the internet on their own, even though they do not offer any products or solutions in this space [Amazon Web Services 2015a; Bosch Software Innovations 2015; Comarch Technologies 2015a, Microsoft 2015a, 2015b]. Thus, these follow the idea of DEVICE GATEWAYS."^^xsd:string ;

                      "Upgradability: Changing or building up a network so that it supports the communication technology required by the device is often not possible.

               <https://purl.org/patternpedia/internetofthingspatterns#result> "A DEVICE GATEWAY is usually a dedicated hardware appliance that can translate between a number of heterogeneous communication technologies. In many cases, it will be located at the edge of the network, close to the devices which it connects to the backend. It is possible to integrate a DEVICE GATEWAY into the backend, but this is often not practical. It is often used to translate low-power shortrange communication to IP communication, so it has to be located close to these devices, whereas the backend is usually located far away. For communication translation, it has to support at least two, but more commonly multiple communication technologies. On the interface towards the backend it usually supports IP communication over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or mobile networks. On the interfaces towards the devices, it usually supports some kind of low energy communication technology. Depending on its application, it might also contain additional interfaces supporting other protocols. A translation layer converts messages received from either the backend or the devices to messages that can be sent to the respective opponent interface and vice versa. To be able to route the messages to their intended receivers the messages have to container some kind of identifier."^^xsd:string ;

               <https://purl.org/patternpedia/internetofthingspatterns#variant> "Aggregating Device Gateway: Besides translating communication technologies this gateway also aggregates the messages it receives from the devices in some meaningful way. For example, it might average the temperature readings of several devices and send it on once a minute. This is usually done to reduce the number of individual messages which have to be sent to the backend."^^xsd:string ,
                        "Local Processing Device Gateway: In addition to translating communication technologies, this gateway also contains some local processing functionality which could mirror or replace functionality located in the backend. For example, it could contain a local RULES ENGINE which decides some actions directly on the gateway. This is usually done to minimize communication with the backend and therefore reduce latency or to insulate from connection loss between gateway and backend."^^xsd:string .
