               :examples "Central hubs are a common occurrence in the product portfolios of home automation companies. Here they often act as an indispensable central point for integrating and managing the actual home automation devices. Examples are the Samsung SmartThings Hub [SmartThings 2015] which supports ZigBee, Z-Wave, and IP, or the Wink Hub [Wink 2015] that additionally supports Bluetooth Low Energy and Lutron Clear Connect7. The SmartThings Hub v2 also introduced local processing capabilities, which is also supported by other DEVICE GATEWAYS like the THNGHUB [EVRYTHNG 2016]. Various companies offer development kits and appliances to implement DEVICE GATEWAYS for industrial use, such as Intel, Dell, or Nexcom [Dell 2016; Intel 2016; Nexcom 2016]. The Eclipse Kura project is an Open Source framework for building the software side of DEVICE GATEWAYS [Eclipse Foundation 2016]. Zachariah et al. [2015] proposed to use smartphones with Bluetooth Low Energy as universal gateways for other devices. In a way, smartphones are already used as DEVICE GATEWAYS for many wearable devices, like fitness trackers or smartwatches, which completely rely on the smartphone to communicate the data they collected to the backend. Many IoT platform documentations mention physical hubs or field gateways as a way to connect devices to their platforms that cannot connect to the internet on their own, even though they do not offer any products or solutions in this space [Amazon Web Services 2015a; Bosch Software Innovations 2015; Comarch Technologies 2015a, Microsoft 2015a, 2015b].

It is possible to integrate a DEVICE GATEWAY into the backend, but this is often not practical. It is often used to translate low-power short- range communication to IP communication, so it has to be located close to these devices, whereas the backend is usually located far away.
For communication translation, it has to support at least two, but more commonly multiple communication technologies. On the interface towards the backend it usually supports IP communication over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or mobile networks. On the interfaces towards the devices, it usually supports some kind of low energy communication technology. Depending on its application, it might also contain additional interfaces supporting other protocols. A translation layer converts messages received from either the backend or the devices to messages that can be sent to the respective opponent interface and vice versa. To be able to route the messages to their intended receivers the messages have to container some kind of identifier."""^^xsd:string ;

              :problem "Some devices will be only intermittently online in order to save energy or because of network outages. Other components want to interact with them but do not know when they will be reachable."^^xsd:string ;
              :result """By storing persistent virtual representations of the devices on the backend server and communicating only through those, device communication can be decou- pled. This allows reading device state as well as sending device commands even if the device is offline. Essential to this is a persistent storage on the backend that can store virtual device representations reliably for many devices and that can handle read and write access from multiple sources. If commands are saved they should be queued, unless only the newest command is regarded as relevant. When a device reconnects to the backend, which can happen according to a schedule or based on certain events, it can retrieve and process the stored command and update the last known state. To let other components know that a device is online, a flag can be stored with the device shadow. When a device connects or gracefully disconnects it enables or disables this flag itself. Otherwise, the flag is set to false after a certain time of inactivity or by another mechanism, for example by the last will and testament of the MQTT protocol.
Conceivably, DEVICE SHADOW functionality could also be implemented on DEVICE GATEWAYS to allow localized decoupling between devices connected to one DEVICE GATEWAY. This would bring the benefits of a DEVICE SHADOW to these devices, even if the Gateway might be disconnected from the rest of the network from time to time. A problem here could be that a DEVICE GATEWAY might not be able to reli- ably provide the persistent storage that is needed."""^^xsd:string ;
              :solution "Store a persistent virtual representation of each device on some backend server. Include the latest received state from the device, as well as commands not yet sent to the device. Do all communication from and to the device through this virtual version. Synchronize the virtual representation with the actual device state when the device is online."^^xsd:string ;
